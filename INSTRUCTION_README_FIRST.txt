Here is a set of step by step instructions to help you understand how to use TrewBrew to its fullest:

Let's begin by making a simple pale ale I've created a year back.
This specific recipe will be for a 1 gallon batch size.

1.) PROFILE TAB
----------------------
This recipe is a classic American Pale Ale. We first need to see if this beer profile is in the profiles list.

1. Click on the Profiles tab. 
	-Here we can view avalible beer profiles, as we can see American Pale Ale is not on the list!
2. Click on the Add Button and enter these given values to the questions that will pop up.
	-Style Name: American Pale Ale
	-Max Color: 14
	-Min Color: 5
	-Max IBU: 45
	-Min IBU: 30
	-Max ABV: 6.2
	-Min ABV: 4.5
	-Max Original Gravity: 1.060
	-Min Original Gravity: 1.045
	-Max Final Gravity: 1.015
	-Min Final Gravity: 1.010

	-If you've added these values to the correct inputs, you should see your new Beer Profile
	on the list:
	
	American Pale Ale
	----------
	Color: 5L-14L  IBUs: 30-45  ABV: 4.5%-6.2%
	Original Gravity: 1.045 - 1.06
	Final Gravity: 1.01 - 1.015

	- If the beer profile on the list shows different variables, then you've 		probably made a mistake but don't worry! You and click on the "Remove a Profile" 	and type the name of the Profile in the list
	you wish to delete, then try and add it again.

	- Now that your profile is in the list, lets move to the Ingredients tab. Click on it!


2.) INGREDIENTS TAB
----------------------------
A.) MALTS TAB
----------------------------
1. From the Ingredients tab, click on the Malts Tab.
	-Here you can view Malts that are currently in the list ready to be used.

	-Our beer will require two different malts: 2-Row(US), and Cara 30.

	-If you look through the malts in the list, you will see that we hav 2-Row(US), 		but Cara 30 isn't there! Lets Add it!

	-Click on the "Add Button"

	-Add these variables as they are asked:
		- Malts Name: Cara 30
		- Malt Color: 30
		- Pounds Per Gallon(PPG): 34
		- Malt Type: Caramel

	-You've added the new malt! We now have all the malts needed for our delicious 		brew.

	-You can remove a malt from the list as well using the 'remove' button.

-------------------
1. Click on the Hops tab located to the right of the Malts tab.
	-From here we can see all the hops in the list.
	
	-Our beer will require two types of Hops: Amarillo Gold, and Citra. Both are 	already in the list, but if you would like to add another hop variety, you would 	click on the 'add' tab, and input the values asked.

	- If you wanted to add another yeast to the list, click on the 'add' button and 		input the name of the yeast you'd like to add.

3. RECIPE TAB
---------------------------------
1. Add Hops
	-Hops needed to be adding the same type of hops at different times during the 	mash(boil), and different amounts as well, so don't be suprised to see us adding 	the same hops over and over again in the recipe. 
	
	-First, Select 'Citra' from the Hops selection box(The box on the top left)
	
	-Click the 'add' button right next to the selection box and input these variables:
		- Ounces: .1
		- Boil Time: 60
		
	- You've added the first Hop to the recipe. Add the rest:
		Citra: .1 oz  Boil Time: 15
		Amarillo Gold: .2 oz  Boil Time: 15
		
		Citra .2 oz   Boil Time: 1
		Amarillo Gold: .2 oz  Boil Time: 1

2. Add Malts
	- The malts selection box is the located at the top-center of the panel.
	
	- It is currently selected on 2-Row(US), which we need, so click on the 'add' 	button.
	
	- Type in these values when asked:
		- Pounds: 2
		- Ounces: 12
	
	- The fist malt has now been added. It converts the ouces to pounds, which is why
	it's a decimal.
	
	- Add the last malt
		- Locate Cara 30 and click 'add'
		- Pounds: 0
		- Ounces: 4
	
3. Add Yeast
	- As stated before, we want American Ale Yeast, which is already selected. Click 
	'add'.
